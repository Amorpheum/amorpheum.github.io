I am a **Senior Lecturer in the [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} pillar and [Design and Artificial Intelligence](https://dai.sutd.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} programme at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}** and **co-director of [SHUAI Lab](https://shuailab.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}**. In a previous life, I was also a Senior Member of Technical Staff at [DSO](https://www.dso.org.sg/){:target="_blank"} working in Cognition and Human Factors.

I received my PhD in Information Systems from Singapore Management University in Dec 2018, and was fortunate to have been able to work with [Rajesh Balan](https://apollo.smu.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}, [Archan Misra](https://sites.google.com/view/archan-misra){:target="_blank"} and [Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/){:target="_blank"} and my numerous friends and colleagues in [LiveLabs](https://livelabs.smu.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}. I also did a short stint at the [Living Analytics Research Centre](https://larc.smu.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} @ SMU as a postdoctoral fellow before my current faculty position.

My research is in **context-aware interfaces** that can bridge interaction and communication between people and help them empathise with each other. I use techniques such as computer vision, audio processing, and natural language processing to empower these interfaces. My thesis work was on an extended reality (specifically, augmented virtuality) system [Empath-D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1Dvr0iy-X8){:target="_blank"} which utilises computer vision and virtual reality to help mobile user interface designers situate their designs when they design for less abled users.

One focus area of my research is in **healthcare**. I am collaborating with the [Samaritans of Singapore](https://www.sos.org.sg/) combining methods from human-computer interaction and natural language processing to improve their services. I am also working on computer-mediated interventions that help parents of children with speech language developmental disorders provide parent-based care to improve speech delay therapy outcomes. 

The second focus area of my research is in **understanding online communities using natural language processing**. I am co-PI and collaborator for two projects that seek to understand rumour spread using social media. I also work on using large-scale community data to develop interaction mechanisms (e.g., chatbots) that support and communicate care for vulnerable populations.
